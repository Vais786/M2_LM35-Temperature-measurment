## Introduction
 * In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “LM35”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faraheite”. “LM35” sensor provides output based on scale of centigrade.
LM35 is three pin transistor like device. It has VCC, GND and OUTPUT. This sensor provides variable voltage at the output based on temperature.

## Research
### Temperature measurment by LM35 sensor using atmega32
LM35 is an analog sensor that converts the surrounding temperature to a proportional analog voltage. The output from the sensor is connected to one of the ADC channel inputs of the Atmega32 microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format. 

* It should fulfill almost all the process requirements of measuring the temperature of by using LM35 sensor and atmega board.	

## Components
ATMEGA32 Microcontroller, power supply (5v), AVR-ISP PROGRAMMER, JHD_162ALCD (16x2LCD), 100uF capacitor (two pieces), 100nF capacitor, LM35 Temperature Sensor.

### Benefits

Temperature measurment by LM35 sensor using atmega 32 as provides many benefit they are as follows:

### Provides cheap temperature measurment tool.

### For better performance.

### User Friendly.

### Can Select the seats as per choos


## Defining Our Project
### Explanation:
*A digital thermometer is a good project in microcontrollers because it provides an opportunity to learn using sensors to measure the real world signals that are analog in nature. I am trying to describes a similar project based on a Atmega32 microcontroller and an LM35 temperature sensor. LM35 is an analog sensor that converts the surrounding temperature to a proportional analog voltage. The output from the sensor is connected to one of the ADC channel inputs of the Atmega32 microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format. The calibrated temperature is displayed in a 16×2 character LCD, in both °C and °F scales.

*LM35
The LM35 series of temperature sensors are produced by National Semiconductor Corporation and are rated to operate over a -55 °C to 150°C temperature range. The scale factor for temperature to voltage conversion is 10 mV per °C. The LM35 series sensors come in different packages.

*The output voltage from the sensor is converted to a 10-bit digital number using the internal ADC of the aTMEGA32 Since the voltage to be measured by the ADC ranges from 0 to 1.0V (that corresponds to maximum temperature range, 100 °C), the ADC requires a lower reference voltage (instead of the supply voltage Vdd = 5V) for A/D conversion in order to get better accuracy.

## High Level Requirements: 
A digital thermometer is a good project in microcontrollers because it provides an opportunity to learn using sensors to measure the real world signals that are analog in nature.

##  Low level Requirements:
Low Plan for the temperature measurment using LM35 sensor is that we can use another sensor and lower cost sensor such as DHT11 for temperature measurment. Another option is to replace the board to  the low cost board.
