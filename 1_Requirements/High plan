A digital thermometer is a good project in microcontrollers because it provides an opportunity to learn using sensors to measure the real world signals that are analog in nature. I am trying to describes a similar project based on a Atmega32 microcontroller and an LM35 temperature sensor. LM35 is an analog sensor that converts the surrounding temperature to a proportional analog voltage. The output from the sensor is connected to one of the ADC channel inputs of the Atmega32 microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format. The calibrated temperature is displayed in a 16×2 character LCD, in both °C and °F scales.
